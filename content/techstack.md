# techstack


This page contains a list of all the technologies I've used for past projects.
They're roughly ordered in terms of experience; I primarily use the technologies
listed first.

## Programming and markup languages

- TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), Ruby, HTML5, CSS3, Python, Rust, C, C++

## Client-side (frontend) frameworks

- **SPA (Single Page Application)**: React, Quasar, Vue.js

- **PWA (Progressive Web Application)**: React, Quasar, Vue.js

- **SSR (Server-side Rendering)**: React, Quasar, NuxtJS

- **SSG (Static Site Generation)**: React, Jekyll, NuxtJS, Vuepress

## Server-side (backend) frameworks

- **Node.js**: Express

- **Ruby**: Ruby on Rails

## Databases

I mostly interact with these through abstractions like ORMs or backend
frameworks.

- **SQL**: PostgreSQL (via `ActiveRecord` in Rails)

- **NoSQL**: MongoDB (via MongoID in Rails)

## Testing utilities

Snapshot tests rock.

- Frameworks: Jest, Mocha

- React testing utilities: `@testing-library/react`, Enzyme.

## Cloud infrastructures

I'm no devops wizard, but I can build a fine pipeline.

- Google cloud platform API (Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Functions)

- Netlify CMS and Netlify functions (same as AWS Lambda really)

- Amazon EC2, S3, Lambda

## React.js

I vastly prefer the Hook API and functional components over class components.

- **Component libraries**: Material-UI

- **State management library**: Redux with Hook API (`@reduxjs/toolkit`)

- **GraphQL React client library**: Apollo client

- **Icon libraries**: React Feather, Material-UI icons.

## Vue.js libraries

I pretty much always use the Composition API for Vue, mainly for its better
type inference and code structure.

- **Component libraries**: Quasar built-ins, Vuetify

- **State management library**: Vuex (there's only one anyways...)

- **Content management system**: `@nuxt/content`, Vuepress


## JavaScript libraries

- **HTTP client**: Axios

- **SVG animation**: Anime, Paper.js

- **HTML5 canvas graphics**: Paper.js

- **TCP socket communication**: net (node.js built-in)

- **Websocket communication**: Socket.io


## Development tools

- **Bundlers/transpilers**: **Vite**, Webpack + Babel

- **Linters**: ESLint (preferably StandardJS preset)

- **CSS preprocessors**: Sass, SCSS

- **CI/CD platforms**: Netlify, CircleCI

- **GitHub Apps**: Semantic Pull Requests

- **Package managers**: Yarn, NPM

- **Process managers**: PM2

- **Task automation**: nodemon, concurrently

- **Text editor**: VSCode and a dropdown Tmux terminal


## Technologies I want to learn later

- Rust, Go, or some other fun new programming language

- Gulp (debugging webpack loaders sucks, and I hope this is the answer)

- Pug or some other HTML preprocessor (XML is my mortal enemy)

- Octane, SunSpider, or some other performance benchmarker (what's the point of writing clean code if I don't get to prove it?)

- Selenium WebDriver (testing, webscrapers for data analysis, scripting my online orders)

- Django, Flask, or some other Python backend (because JavaScript isn't exactly made to run numpy, pandas, or neural networks)
